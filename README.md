# Connect 4 in Java

## Project Overview
This is a simple Connect 4 game implemented in Java. The project consists of two game modes:
1. **Two-Player Mode**: Two human players take turns placing pieces on a console-based board.
2. **Single-Player Mode**: One player competes against a basic AI that makes simple decisions.

The game is played in a 6-row by 7-column grid, following the classic Connect 4 rules.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Console-based interface for easy play.
- Valid move checks to prevent invalid placements.
- Automatic win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal victory conditions).
- Simple AI opponent (random move selection, with potential for future improvements).

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## How to Play
- Players take turns selecting a column (1-7) to drop their pieces.
- The game checks for a winner after every move.
- If a player connects four pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win.
- If all columns are full and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
- In **single-player mode**, the AI will make its move automatically after the player.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve the AI with basic algorithms, like Minimax.
